Installing GooCalendar
======================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python (http://www.python.org/)
 * GooCanvas >= 2.0 (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GooCanvas)
 * gtk+ 3.20 or later and py-gobject3 3.20 or later (http://www.gtk.org/)

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the GooCalendar source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:
